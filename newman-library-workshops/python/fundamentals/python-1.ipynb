    "\n",
    "- **Integers** → whole numbers (`int`)\n",
    "- **Floats** → decimal numbers (`float`)\n",
    "- **Strings** → text (`str`)\n",

    "Think of how almost anything from the real world can be broken down and fundamentally represented by these data types (books, digital music, photographs, streaming video...).  Once information is represented digitally, we gain the power to create, edit, and share that information in ways that were never before possible. This the foundation of programming!\n",

    "  - `print()` → outputs values to the screen. When using `print()` think: **\"this is for the benefit of me, for me to view and evaluate.\"** `print()` is the most basic form of debugging. \n",
    "  - `type()` → shows the data type of a value or variable... for the data types discussed above!\n",
